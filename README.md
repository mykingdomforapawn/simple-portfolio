# simple-portfolio

> This project is part of my software architecture journey. See my [software-architecture-journey](https://github.com/mykingdomforapawn/software-architecture-journey) repository for more details.

This simple project lets the user interact with an application in the terminal to set up and play around with a combination of a savings account and a stock portfolio.

## Why?

Having worked with other programming languages, I needed a small and comprehensive project to get into Java specifics. I did not want to create an application that is useful for others, but just get a feeling of the programming language by trying out some basic concepts.

## How?

I started by watching some videos explaining the basics of Java and then brainstormed ideas on projects that could be implemented using these concepts. Quickly, the learning process became a guided project with me learning something new and then instantly trying to implement the simplest version of that into the application. 

## What?

- Basic Java project setup in IntelliJ
- Classes and objects
- Fields, constructors, methods, accessors & mutators
- Static members
- Control statements
- User interaction with application running in terminal
